### *My approach to science*

As an electronic engineer, my abition is to build revolutionary chips that are extremely energy-efficient, computationally powerful, exhibiting intelligence. To do this, I leverage machine learning and neuroscience principles. The first has demonstrated a path towards generalized intelligence, the latter how to make it human-like and energy-efficient.

In the buisness of building complex electronic circuits it is fundamental to be analytical and quantitative. Only trust the calculations and the data. This drives the engineering side of my scientific quest. But building something profoundly innovative requires a radical approach. This is why creativity and out-of-the-box thinking are also part of my attitude.
