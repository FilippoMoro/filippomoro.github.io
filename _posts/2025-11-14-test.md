Memory technology has become the major battleground for integrated chips innovation. Our chips' integrated memory is ever-growing and now occupies a considerable portion of commercial silicon dies. While Static-Random-Access-Memory technology dominates the on-chip memory market, an article pointed out that SRAM's scaling - fueled so far by Moore's Law - is hitting a wall. TSMC's 3nm node only provides a minor improvement (about 5%) in SRAM bitcell density compared to the 5nm node. So what is the future for on-chip memory? Here I explore the current on-chip memory to extrapolate what the future might look like. More importantly, this article links to a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qB0eTERsOAq3VRLizeE9IMj2wXXSUNgyxcXAxigXpuM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) where I gather data on all the memory devices featured in the plots. You can access this spreadsheet freely and will find all the information about the given memory devices as well as a reference to the scientific paper they were featured in.

### Memory is all you need
Memory technology has become the major battleground for integrated chip innovation. Our chips' integrated memory is ever-growing and now occupies a considerable portion of commercial silicon dies. While Static-Random-Access-Memory technology dominates the on-chip memory market, an article pointed out that SRAM's scaling - fueled so far by Moore's Law - is hitting a wall [1]. TSMC's 3nm node only provides a minor improvement (about 5%) in SRAM bitcell density compared to the 5nm node. Then what is the future for on-chip memory? Some suggest that the shift from FinFET to Nanosheet transistor technology will propel the continuation of CMOS - and SRAM as well - scaling. Others highlight that alternative solutions exist: several emerging memory cells have been developed with the aim of going beyond standard CMOS and exploiting different physical phenomena to store information in memory cells. Among such innovative devices, Resistive-RAM (RRAMs) [2], Phase-Change-Memory (PCM) [3], Magnetic-RAM (MRAM) [4], Ferroelectric-RAM (FeRAM) [5], 2T-Gain-Cells [6] or eDRAM [7]. Albeit far less mature than SRAM, these devices (except for 2T-Gain-Cells and eDRAM) are non-volatile, thus promising energy efficiency, and can easily be integrated into the Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) of common CMOS processes, thus enabling high integration memory density.

This article offers a birdseye view of the memory technology landscape, analyzing the development SRAM until the most recent nodes, and assessing the performance of the alternative emerging memory devices. Importantly, this article is inspired by this excellent review [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10488872) from Prof. Shimeng Yu. I build on top of this article finding the relevant sources in the literature and providing my own opinions on the future of memory technology. You can access all the information contained in this article from this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qB0eTERsOAq3VRLizeE9IMj2wXXSUNgyxcXAxigXpuM/edit?gid=0#gid=0): it features scientific references and technical information to a lot of memory devices.
